# dara-optimal-control

This code is associated with the research project provisionally titled "Optimal control of Multiple Myeloma assuming drug evasion and off-target effects". It implements simulation (numerical solution of a boundary value problem) and optimal control calculation for a model of Multiple Myeloma treatment with the drug Daratumumab, featuring drug evasion and off-target effects. Two cost functions are implemented, corresponding to the continuous and bang-bang controls.

The code is set up to run ad-hoc experiments. Examples can be executed by opening optimal_control_examples.m or simulation_examples.m and running selected code blocks. These examples can be adapted and executed in a script.
