# dara-optimal-control

This code is associated with the research project titled "Optimal control of Multiple Myeloma assuming drug resistance and off-target effects". It implements simulation (numerical solution of a boundary value problem) and optimal control calculation for a model of Multiple Myeloma treatment with the drug Daratumumab, featuring drug resistance and off-target effects. Three cost functions are implemented, a linear and quadratic function and a weighted average of both.

The code is set up to run ad-hoc experiments. Examples can be executed by opening optimal_control_examples.m, simulation_examples.m or other_calculations_examples.m and running selected code blocks. These examples can be adapted and executed in a script.
